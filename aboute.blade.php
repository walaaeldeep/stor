            The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest of all the Egyptian pyramids and is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is located around 5 miles to the west of the Nile River near the city of Cairo, Egypt
              
The Great Pyramid of Giza is part of a larger complex called the Giza Necropolis. There are two other major pyramids in the complex including the Pyramid of Khafre and the Pyramid of Menkaure. It also includes the Great Sphinx and several cemeteries

When the pyramid was built, it was around 481 feet tall. Today, because of erosion and the removal of the top piece, the pyramid is around 455 feet tall. At its base, each side is
approximately 755 feet long. That's well over twice as long as a football field 

In addition to being tall, the pyramid is a massive structure. It covers an area of over 13 acres and is constructed with around 2.3 million stone blocks. Each of the stone blocks is estimated to weigh over 2000 pounds </p>

<p>    Since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, the situation of Russia, the largest continent state in the world, is particularly complex. The USSR breaks out into fifteen independent sovereign states, including Russia, which has inherited from the former superpower three-quarters of its territory, more than half of its population, two-thirds of its industry and half of its agricultural production  Today Russia is a Soviet Federalist Socialist Republic presided over by Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin.
    Its population is estimated at 142,500,482 in 2013 with a life expectancy of nearly 70 years. Its area is 17 098 242 km 2 and the country straddles North Asia and Europe. The territory extends over 9000km and has 9 time zones. Its capital is Moscow, its official language is Russian and its currency is the Russian Ruble. The Human Development Index (HDI) in 2012 was 0.788 (high index). It should be noted that 110 people hold 35% of Russia's wealth in 2013     </p>
